# 👋 Hi there, I’m Sanjay  
**Undergraduate Developer • MERN Stack • Machine Learning Enthusiast**

## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing my passion for software development and machine-learning. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on full-stack web applications (especially using the MERN stack), hybrid ML frameworks, and real-time systems. My goal is to build solutions that are both **impactful** and **user-friendly**.

**What drives me:**
- Turning **data** into meaningful insights and actionable systems.  
- Building **clean**, **scalable**, and **well-documented** code.  
- Learning and integrating emerging technologies (such as LWC, React, FastAPI, etc.).  
- Collaborating in open-source and sharing knowledge.

## 🔧 Skills & Tech Stack  
| Area | Technologies |
|------|-------------|
| Frontend | React, Lightning Web Components (LWC), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, FastAPI, RESTful APIs |
| Databases & Storage | MongoDB, SQL (Basic), LocalStorage / session management |
| Machine Learning / AI | Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (basic), DL/ML integration |
| DevOps & Deployment | Git/GitHub, GitHub Actions (basic), Docker (intro) |
| Projects & Systems | MERN Full-Stack Apps, Hybrid ML frameworks, Real-time systems, Quiz applications |

## 🚀 Selected Projects  
Here are a few projects that reflect my current focus and growth:

- **Disaster Management System** – A real-time web application built with MERN stack that tracks disasters, coordinates emergency responses and displays maps/charts.  
- **Hybrid ML Framework for Parkinson’s Detection** – Developed a minimal-input approach using only six biomedical features (['MDVP:Fo(Hz)', 'Jitter(%)', 'Shimmer', 'HNR', 'spread1', 'spread2']) to detect Parkinson’s disease. Includes a modern React frontend + FastAPI backend + AI-driven recommendation system.  
- **Full-Stack Quiz Application** – Built a web application with two roles (Admin & User). Admins can create quizzes, auto-generate questions, view results with graphs; users can log in, take quizzes, view scores.  
- **MERN Stack Projects** – Various apps (e.g., “495_mernstack”) exploring CRUD, authentication, local storage, styling & UI/UX improvements.  
- **Machine Learning – News Classification** – Classified news articles into categories using machine-learning techniques. Designed for my exam/project paper with detailed research.
